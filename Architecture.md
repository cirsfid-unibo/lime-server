# LIME-server architecture

LIME-server is an Express application divided in submodules.

## documentsdb

This is the module used by LIME.

Endpoints:
- *documentsdb/Users*: handles user registration, login and preferences
- *documentsdb/Documents*: generic document repository. It supports both the Exist and Filesystem backend.
- *documentsdb/Export*: service for temporarily exporting a file in the document repository to a public url.

Mongodb is used for storing users. Filesystem or ExistDb is used to store files.

This submodule should contain generic xml services, like validation and or xslt conversions.   
Currently it only contains the NIR to AkomaNtoso converter.
